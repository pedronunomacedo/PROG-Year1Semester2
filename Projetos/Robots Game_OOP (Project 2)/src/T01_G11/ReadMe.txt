T01_G11

GOUP MEMBERS:
-> Duarte Filipe Campos Barbosa Lopes
-> Pedro Nuno Ferreira Moura de Macedo

ADDITIONAL SPECIFICATIONS:
-> None.

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT STATE:
-> Every objective was accomplished.
-> We added one improvement: once the game ends the player is asked if he wants to play again and the program restarts.

MAIN DIFFICULTIES:
-> We found it very difficult to get our heads wrapped around classes, but once we did it went pretty smoothly.
-> It took us a while to figure everything out so we only started to really make progress on friday the 28th and that made us write everything in a bit of a rush but managed to get it done.

WINNING COMBINATIONS:
