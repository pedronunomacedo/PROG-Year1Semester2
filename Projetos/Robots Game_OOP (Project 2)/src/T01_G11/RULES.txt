 ------ RULES ------
 You are placed in a maze made up of hight-voltage fences and posts.
 There are also some interceptor robots that will try to destroy you.
 If you touch the maze or any of the robots, you died and its the end of the game. The robots are also destroyed when they touch the fences/posts or when they collide with each other.
 Every time you move to any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagnally) to a contiguous cell, each robot moves one cell closer to your location, in wichever direction is the shortest path.
 The robots have no vision sensors but they have an accurate odour sensor that allows them to follow you!
 There is one hope! Make the robots hit the maze or each other.
 If all of them are destroyed, you WIN!
