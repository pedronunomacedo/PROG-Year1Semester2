### GROUP MEMBERS (T01_G11):

### PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT STATE:
* All the objetives were accomplished!
* Improvements:
    * Movements table explaining what the user input should be to move the player
    * Ask the user if he wants to play again and restart

### MAIN DIFFICULTIES (Everything is currenty solved):
* Robots' movement:
    * When two robots collided, one died and the other was still alive
    * If a robot would die, the next one wouldn't move

* Winner's File:
    * Store the game time of the player in the file MAZE_XX_WINNERS.TXT neatly
    * If the time was higher than the ones already stored in the file it wouldn't insert in the last line
    * As the winner's file was getting bigger it would duplicate or triplicate the line when inserting it

* Options:
    * When the user would insert a valid option followed by another character, the program would read only the first character and assume as a valid input

### WINNING COMBINATIONS:
* **MAZE_01**: D D D D W Q Z C D C D D D D
* **MAZE_02**: E E X A W X D C Z Q E S D D S S D E C D D W W W S S S S S S S
* **MAZE_03**: X Z Z Z Q A C X X S Z C S S S S S S
